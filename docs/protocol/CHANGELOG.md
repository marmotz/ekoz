## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial protocol skeleton: transport principles (HTTP + SSE + signed
  server↔server REST), per-room event model with a monotonic `seq`, list of
  sections to write.
- Transport conventions: `application/problem+json` errors with a stable `code`,
  ULID identifiers, UTC ISO-8601 timestamps, `X-Request-Id` correlation
  (see ADR 0017).
- Discovery document at `GET /.well-known/ekoz` fully specified in
  [`discovery.md`](discovery.md): request/caching rules, response fields,
  `KeyEntry` shape (raw base64 Ed25519 `public_key`, `valid_from`,
  `valid_until`), and active/retired signing-key semantics with `keyId` lookup.
- Identity surface (draft): `name/server` identifier rules, auth token model
  (JWT access + rotating opaque refresh, reuse detection), session objects,
  SSE stream ticket.
- Conversations surface (draft): `room` object with `type`, capability list and
  permission resolution, `room_event` types and per-room `seq`,
  `GET /sync` and `GET /events` (per-account fan-in feed with its own cursor),
  restricted-Markdown message body, structured mentions, read markers,
  presence/typing signals.
